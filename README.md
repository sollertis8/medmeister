MedMeister App

## Description

MedMeister is an application that allows users to quickly find doctors near them.  Users can search for doctors by specialty or insurance taken.  With MedMeister, the user has a breadth of information about doctors at their fingertips - from the doctor’s name, practice, specialty, the insurance companies the doctor works with and more.

## The MedMeister App has three pages.

## Home Page
The Home Page is where the user searches for doctors near them.  We get the user location using gps from the browser.  Next,the user can search for doctors by specialty, insurance accepted, and specify a radius for the search. The user then gets results based on their location.

## Results Page
The Results page is where the user sees the results of their doctor search.  Each doctor has their own card with brief information on the front and back of the cards. On the back of the card, the user can click the "view more" link and the doctor's profile modal will be shown.

## Profile Modal
The Profile modal is where the user can get more detailed information about a doctor including the doctor’s full bio, specialty, practice and contact information, insurance taken, and a map of where the doctor's practice is in relation to the user.
