MedMeister App

## Description

MedMeister is an application that allows users to quickly find doctors near them.  Users can search for doctors by specialty or insurance taken.  With MedMeister, the user has a breadth of information about doctors at their fingertips - from the doctor’s name, practice, specialty, the insurance companies the doctor works with and more.

## The MedMeister App has three pages.

## Home Page
The Home Page is where the user searches for doctors near them using their zip code.  The user can search for doctors by either specialty or insurance taken.  The map on the home page will show the user’s location using a pin on a map.

## Results Page
The Results page is where the user sees the results of their doctor search.  In addition to showing the location of doctors near the user on a map, each doctor has their own card with brief information on the front and back of the cards. The user can click the back of the card to be taken to the doctor’s profile page.

## Profile Page
The Profile page is where the user can get more detailed information about a doctor including the doctor’s education, specialty, full bio, practice information, rating, insurance taken, and more.
